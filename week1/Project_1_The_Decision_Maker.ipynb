        "* **Follow-up questions**: Your program could ask a question only if the user answered the first question a particular way. This would probably involve `if` statements in the `input()` part of the program as well as nested `if` statements inside `calculate_score` itself. You could even use default arguments in your `calculate_score` function if that makes the code cleaner.\n",
        "* **Error checking**: What if you ask a user a yes/no question and they answer \"maybe\"? Or if you ask them for a numeric answer but they write a word or type a \"$\" in front? You can do some error checking after receiving each answer to make sure it is compatible with what `calculate_score` expects, and if not, you can try to convert it into an appropriate response or ask the user a follow-up question to clarify.\n",
        "* **Explore ethical implications**: Now is also a good time to reflect on the fairness of decision making algorithms in general. If your program made a decision about resource allocation, consider which people might receive the most harm/benefit from its scoring algorithm. Continue with some reading on ethical decision making algorithms:\n",
